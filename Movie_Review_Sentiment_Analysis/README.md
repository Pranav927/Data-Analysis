**Introduction to Movie Review Analysis Project:**

- **Objective**: This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using machine learning techniques.
- **Tools Used**: Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, and Streamlit are employed for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.
- **Dataset**: The IMDb movie reviews dataset is utilized, with a subset randomly selected for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Text data undergoes cleaning, including lowercase conversion, HTML tag removal, punctuation removal, and stop word removal.
- **Model Training**: Two classification models, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, are trained on the preprocessed text data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Model accuracies are evaluated on a test set, providing insights into their performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters of the Random Forest classifier are tuned using Grid Search Cross-Validation to optimize model performance.
- **Results**: The project concludes with the evaluation of the tuned Random Forest model's accuracy and a classification report showcasing precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
